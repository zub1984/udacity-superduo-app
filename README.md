# SuperDuo : An android project for Udacity students!


###Welcome to the SuperDuo! project
This repository actually contains 2 projects; the _**alexandria**_ app that allows for scanning and maintaining a list of books, and the _**Football**_ app where we can follow soccer matches and their results. 
This Readme covers the release notes of both apps, beginning with the alexandria.
